MAL
----------------------------
Mighty Asgrim's Library. Just a collection of lib classes for Zend Framework
I've made that sort of make my life easier. Some of them may actually overlap
ZF built-in functionality, but these are mainly just me messing around!

INSTALLATION
----------------------------
1. Put MAL in library/MAL/*
2. Add this to application.ini

    autoloaderNamespaces[] = "MAL_"

3. Drink some wine (you'll need it...)
