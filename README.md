MAL
----------------------------
Mighty Asgrim's Library. Just a collection of lib classes for Zend Framework 1
I've made that sort of make my life easier. Some of them may actually overlap
ZF built-in functionality, but these are mainly just me messing around!

Released under The BSD License (see LICENSE for details)

INSTALLATION
----------------------------
1. Add `asgrim/mal` to your `composer.json`
2. Run `php composer.phar update` or `php composer.phar install`
3. Add this line to your application.ini

    autoloaderNamespaces[] = "MAL_"

4. Drink some wine (you'll need it...)

FUTURE STUFF
----------------------------
Stuff I may or may not add in the future:

 o A basic eCommerce system (models/mappers/Db_Tables/actions/etc.)
 o A basic HTML CMS (models/mappers/Db_Tables/actions/etc.)
